### **Post 3: Customer Story - Wedding Flowers**
**Caption:**
"💒 Sarah & David's Wedding Story

When Sarah told us her grandmother's garden was the inspiration for her wedding bouquet, we knew we had to create something truly special. 

🌸 We preserved flowers from her grandmother's garden, mixed with seasonal blooms in soft pastels, and created a bouquet that told 3 generations of love stories.

Sarah said: 'It's not just flowers - it's my family's legacy in my hands on my wedding day.'

This is why we do what we do. Every gift tells a story. What's yours?
